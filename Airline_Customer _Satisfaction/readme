In the airline industry, customer satisfaction occurs when passengers’ expectations are met through the airline experience. Considering that airline service quality is the main factor in obtaining new and retaining existing customers, airline companies are applying various approaches to improve the quality of the physical and social services capes. As COVID-19 hit the world and the situation rapidly evolved in 2020, many industries were affected by the pandemic, especially the airline industry. Many countries created travel restrictions and bans, which greatly changed and challenged the operation of airline companies. The airline industry consistently faces great challenges to maintain satisfaction levels. Since COVID-19 will affect the future of travel and further impact the customer experience, we need to identify the most important factors that influence satisfaction amid changing travel dynamics. The execution of customer service is critical, because the best way to increase aeronautical revenue is to increase customer satisfaction. It is common to use data analysis techniques for analyzing customer propensity in marketing. However, their application to the airline industry has traditionally focused solely on surveys; hence, there is a lack of attention paid to deep learning techniques based on survey results. This study has two purposes. The first purpose is to find the relationship between various factors influencing customer churn risk and satisfaction by analyzing the airline customer data. For this, we applied deep learning techniques to the survey data collected from the users who have used mostly Garud Airlines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the one of the few attempts at applying deep learning to analyze airline customer propensities. The second purpose is to analyze the influence of the social services cape, including the viewpoints of the passenger’s using aircraft, on airline customer propensities.
